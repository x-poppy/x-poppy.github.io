`poppy` is a web admin application.

It's also a application system which has hight flexible customization not only the frontend side but also the backend side.

:star2: Star us on GitHub — it helps! :clap:

## Background

There're lots of admin application templates for front-end. But we need a common solution not only the front-end but also the server side. so the `poppy admin` comes up. `poppy admin` includes all the front-end and backend logics and give the flexible for integration. so finally we just need to focus ours own business logic side not the admin web server.
